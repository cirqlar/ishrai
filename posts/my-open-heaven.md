Lesbian Gay and Bisexual Persons are forced to deal with the effects of discriminatory legislation which criminalizes their behaviour. These laws and the resulting fear of discrimination, violence, and arrests further prevent them from accessing health services.

Not only are Lesbian Gay and Bisexual Person suffering from HIV and Human Rights abuse at a much higher prevalence rate, but they are simultaneously difficult to reach with appropriate interventions. This is because key populations are often mobile, stigmatized, unable to self-identify, marginalized, and at a higher risk of physical abuse. Due to these factors, it is difficult for most organizations to reach key populations with accurate, non-judgmental educational materials that are rights-based and gender-sensitive. Specialized and carefully adapted intervention techniques are required. Additionally, the lack of KP-friendly and competent care in public and private health facilities and other service delivery points further increases the vulnerability of key populations by discouraging them from accessing services.

As a strategy to reach the key population, ISHRAI an LGB-led/focused organization has been implementing intervention programs to improve the livelihood of target populations. Key activities include:

* Capacity building in the area of sexual and human rights for key populations.
* Centre-based counselling, IEC (Information, Education, Communication) or peer education sessions.
* Law reforms and policy dialogues at the community, state and national levels.
* Periodic outreach activities to communities.
* Consultancy services on sexuality, gender and human rights issues.
