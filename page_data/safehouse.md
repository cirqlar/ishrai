Many people are on the streets, or in abusive homes and need a place to go. ISHRAI has started a safe house program to meet the needs of these people. With room and board and feeding, we can provide a place for people who have none.

We also provide training and growth initiatives for participants of the program to ensure that they need not depend on us forever. With our help, they can build a new life for themselves and get back on their feet.

If you're interested in the safehouse program and would like to learn more, please [contact us]().
