Here at ISHRAI, our work requires a lot. We strive daily to ensure that no one is left alone without basic amenities and the help they need. Doing this is no cheap task and it takes a lot of money to keep us going. Being an NGO, we don't make any money from this, but our reward is the change we can facilitate in the lives of those we help/save.

You can help widen our reach and save actual lives. Nothing is too little and everything donated goes a long way to saving helping us change the world, and more importantly, the lives of those who need it. If you believe in our mission, please [contact us](/contact "contact us") to help out.
